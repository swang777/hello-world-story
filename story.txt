Once upon a time, a king and queen ruled over a distant land. The queen was kind and lovely and all the people of the realm adored her. The only sadness in the queen's life was that she wished for a child but did not have one. 

Differently, the queen's sister, Mary, has a large family. She and her husband gave birth to 5 children. The King's couple love children very much and they want to adopt the youngest daughter from Mary's family.
