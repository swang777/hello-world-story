Once upon a time, a king and queen ruled over a distant land. The queen was kind and lovely and all the people of the realm adored her. The only sadness in the queen's life was that she wished for a child but did not have one. 

Differently, the queen's sister, Mary, has a large family. She and her husband gave birth to 5 children. The King's couple love children very much and they want to adopt the youngest daughter from Mary's family.

Mary refused the King's request, with the reason that she loved all her children too much to let any one of them go.
In a rage, the King ordered Mary's and her husband's exile, leaving Mary's children as orphans. The King then
adopted Mary's children to take care of them. However, the children know what the King did to their parents, and
they make a plot for revenge.

They plotted to overthrow their aunt and uncle, by slowly turning their kingdom against them. They began with the peasants and gradually made their way to the clergy. Finally, they got everyone in the kingdom to rebel against the King and Queen.
